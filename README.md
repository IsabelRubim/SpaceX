# Angular SpaceX GraphQL Codegen

Angular application that lists previous SpaceX releases, plus an associated detailed page. The data is provided through the [SpaceX GraphQL API](https://medium.com/open-graphql/launching-spacex-graphql-api-b3d7029086e0) and the angular service is generated via [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/). I also used [Apollo Angular](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/angular/) to access data from the frontend.

:rocket: You can see it [here](https://project-spacex.netlify.app/).
